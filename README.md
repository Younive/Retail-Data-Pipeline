Overview
========

In this project, I designed and implemented an ELT data pipeline, leveraging Google Cloud Storage as a robust Data Lake, Google BigQuery as a high-performance Data Warehouse, and Apache Airflow as the orchestrator. The entire system is seamlessly orchestrated locally through the Astro CLI.
